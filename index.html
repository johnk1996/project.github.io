            <h1>Welcome to my software developer page my name is Kyle John</h1><br>
            <p>Welcome to my first HTML, CSS & Javascript project. I hope to
            to display an array of new skills and softwares I have learn't 
            along my journey. I studied business management & Economics at
            university however as I left as started working in the office I
            realised I need to work on something I enjoy which lead me to 
            software development. During Covid, my last job on the Hs2 Project 
            and when i got made redundant I 
            tried to use garner qualifications which could to help lead me into 
            the software development/ analytics field. This lead lead to me getting
            a prince 2 agile qualification and Skills Bootcamps in Software
            Development at Just IT.
            </p>

            <p>With the help of Justit training I was able to develop my software
            skills by learning Javascript, HTML, CSS, Mysql & Python. Since I have
            completed my software skills bootcamp I have been developing my skills
            cloud computing and software skills by independent learning softwares 
            such as linux & Azure leading to me gaining my Microsoft Certified: 
            Azure Fundamentals AZ-900.</p>
